Element Sensor
===================

Element Sensor is a purely event based element size changing detector, which means intermitten checking free.

Element Sensor is stolen from Marc J. Schmidt's [Element Queries component](https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries), I refactored the code to make it consume less memory and be lightly faster by reduce the number of function instances. Also by separate it from the original repo, it will be much easier to be reused.

Please contact if you feel the ownership should be transfered.
